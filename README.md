# Cleansing of Uber rides data
This is a project to cleanse a data set using Python code

There are three main sections to this work, detecting syntactical and semantical anomalies in a provided data set.

The data set contains information on some Uber rides in Melbourne including source and destination of the trip, the length of the trip, time of the day, fare and etc. there are some assumptions provided as part of the work regarding the dataset including three categories of Uber types and linear association of the fare with some features in the data. The task for me in part 1 of the project is to apply an extensive EDA on the data set to detect any types of anomalies that may exist and find methods to cleanse the data and provide an output.

In other parts of the project I have been provided with two additional dataset which includes missing values and outliers in the data and I was tasked with finding methods of imputing the missing values and detecting and removing the outliers.

Working on this project has allowed me to utilise and explore various techniques in Machine learning including linear regression to build and train a linear model on the data to be able to impute missing values and also use of classification algorithm, K-nearest neighbours (KNN) to correct region of the source and destination of the Uber rides. Other techniques explored includes outlier detection with use of IQR range calculation of the residuals of predictions on the data which allows for an effective approach in removing existing true outliers in the data set. I have also used Tableau in parts of the EDA to visualise regions in the data set.
